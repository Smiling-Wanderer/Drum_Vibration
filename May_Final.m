%% Final Project Asher May 5/10/18
%This project will model various modes of vibration of a circular drum. We
%choose to input a certain material type and radius of the drum, and the
%program (via a gui) will output the various modes of vibration of that
%particular drum... and compare where the various drum mode vibrations occur.

%Here our Drum_Vibration class will be called.
